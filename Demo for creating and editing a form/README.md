# How to run?

- This is an angular cli project.
- Before running this project, make sure you execute "npm install" to install all the dependencies.
- Then "ng serve".

## Note

###### Follow these steps if angular's API is not installed.

- I used angular's  `InModuleWebApi` so make sure you install `in module web api` using "npm i angular2-in-memory-web-api". Go to https://www.npmjs.com/package/angular2-in-memory-web-api for more information.

- Data you save to API will not be available after application restart.
